##Distance measuring system using at mega16 

1. Use ATmega32 Microcontroller with frequency 8Mhz.
2. Measure the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04. Check the “HC-SR04 
Ultrasonic MT Student Tutorial” pdf file to understand how to interface with this 
sensor.
3. The LCD should display the distance
4.  The project should be design and implemented based on the layered architecture 
model
